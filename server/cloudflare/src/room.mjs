// One co-op room, as its own Durable Object. Cloudflare starts it near the
// first request for it, which is the host making it, so the host's frames
// and the guests' inputs go through a relay close to the host rather than one
// fixed place. What it does is server/coop-relay.mjs's rooms, one room at a
// time: players come with a ticket from the lobby (lobby.mjs) and send their
// create or join first.
//
// It doesn't hibernate: mid-run it's passing messages all the time anyway.
//
// Cloudflare restarts Durable Objects now and then (runtime updates, moving
// them), which drops every connection and what's in memory. So the room keeps
// itself in storage, and a player whose connection drops is held for
// RESUME_GRACE_MS: their game reconnects with the token the room gave them
// (coop/room/<code>?resume=<token>) and carries on. The host's game resends
// frames a guest missed meanwhile (see CoopRun).
