# Run Escape

A Vampire Survivors-style browser game set in the real Old School RuneScape world. Everything on
screen comes from the OSRS game cache. It's built on
[rs-map-viewer](https://github.com/dennisdev/rs-map-viewer), so `src/rs/` and `src/mapviewer/` are
the viewer's cache and rendering code, and `src/game/` is the game.

The repository and the localStorage keys still say RuneSurvivors or `rune-survivors-*`. The game is
called Run Escape. **Never rename those keys**: players' saves live under them.

## Keep these files up to date

**After every change, check whether this file, `.claude/rules/`, `README.md` and `docs/` still say
what's true, and update them in the same pull request.** That covers new systems, moved files,
changed commands and anything an agent would otherwise get wrong. Leave out counts and numbers that
go stale. Add anything that cost you time to work out.

`src/game/core/` has no DOM or rendering. The UI reads from `GameClient` and `GameStore`, and never
changes the sim directly.

## Commands

```sh
npm install
npm run download-caches    # the game's cache, into caches/
npm start                  # dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm test                   # vitest
npx tsc --noEmit -p .      # type check
npx prettier --write <files>
npm run build && npm run slim-cache    # build for hosting (only when deploying)
```

There's no pre-commit hook, so run Prettier yourself. `npm run lint` formats the whole repository.

## After every change

1. Run the tests and the type check, and format what you changed.
2. **Run a simulation if the change can affect gameplay or balance** (see below).
3. **If you added anything from the cache** (an item, enemy, map, animation or sprite), say so in the
   pull request. Don't run `npm run slim-cache` as part of a change: it's slow and heavy on memory, and
   it's done when deploying. A deployed game with an old slim cache stops on a "missing from the
   cache" error.
4. Try UI and visual changes in the browser. Tests don't cover how things look.
5. Note the change in `CHANGELOG.md` under Unreleased.
6. Update the docs (see [Keep these files up to date](#keep-these-files-up-to-date)).

## Simulations

Run `scripts/game/simulate-run.ts` after any change to weapons, passives, gear, enemies, waves,
bosses, maps, XP, the shop, the Armoury, or combat in `Sim.ts`. Put the before and after numbers in
the pull request. If a sim wasn't run, say so there.

```sh
npx tsx scripts/game/simulate-run.ts wizard 3                # one adventurer, 3 seeds
MAP=barrows npx tsx scripts/game/simulate-run.ts "" 3        # everyone on one map, 3 seeds
MAP=morytania META=max ARMOURY=max npx tsx scripts/game/simulate-run.ts "" 3    # everything bought
ENDLESS=1 npx tsx scripts/game/simulate-run.ts wizard 3      # endless mode
WEAPON=crystal_bow npx tsx scripts/game/simulate-run.ts ranger 3    # one weapon
```

- **Use at least 3 seeds.** A single seed can move a whole group's results by a lot with no real
  change behind it, and any code change sends the RNG down a new path.
- **Compare like with like**: the same adventurers, maps, seeds and `META`/`ARMOURY` settings, on
  the old and new code. `META=max` buys every shop upgrade, so a new one changes those results.
- **Run every map that's affected**, not only Lumbridge. A change can help one map and hurt another.
- For a change to one combat style, compare all three styles, so you can see the gap between them.
- The bot is simple. It doesn't play strike-based adventurers well, so don't judge those from a sim.
  Treat its numbers as a comparison, not as how a player would do.
- Runs are CPU heavy, and full sweeps can take a while. Run them in the background, and don't edit
  `src/` in the same checkout meanwhile, since each run reads the source when it starts.

After a content change, also run the checks that apply:

```sh
npx tsx scripts/cache/check-items.ts          # casket items are the items they're named after
npx tsx scripts/cache/check-fun-outfits.ts    # fun map outfits are what they're named
npx tsx scripts/cache/validate-decoders.ts    # after touching a decoder or changing the cache
```

## Testing in the browser

- In dev, `window.game` is the `GameClient` and `window.game.sim` is the running `Sim`. From the
  console you can call `selectMap(id)`, `startRun()`, `sim.addWeapon(id)` or `sim.spawnBoss(...)`.
- `?autostart=wizard` starts a run right away, `?stress=300` adds goblins, and F3 shows collision.
- Headless Chromium needs `--use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader`, and a persistent
  profile, or the cache won't fit in its storage quota. The cache can take a while to load.
- Effects like swooshes only last a moment, so a screenshot can easily miss them. Check game state
  as well, and don't report an effect as seen unless you saw it.
- Don't serve the game from a git worktree with a symlinked `node_modules`. Vite refuses the files,
  and the failed load can leave a bad cache in the browser profile for that port.

## Conventions

- **Pull requests**: work on a branch and open a pull request. Don't commit to `main`. Keep one
  topic in each pull request, unless asked to combine them.
- **Stage files by name**, not with `git add -A`. `.gitignore` has `caches/`, which only matches a
  folder, so a `caches` symlink gets committed.
- **Changelog**: written for players, in one-line bullets under Added, Changed or Fixed. Keep it
  short, and never mention secret content (like hidden bosses) in it or in map descriptions.
- **Comments**: short, and they say why or what something's for. Match what's around them.
- **Content** is plain data with real cache ids. Look ids up with the scripts, not from memory. OSRS
  names should be spelled as the cache spells them.
- **Saves**: if `SaveData` changes shape, raise `SAVE_VERSION` and add a step to `migrateSave`.
  New shop upgrades, ids and optional fields don't need one.
- **Determinism**: the sim only uses its seeded `Rng`, never `Math.random`.
- **Licence**: the cache belongs to Jagex and stays out of the repository.
