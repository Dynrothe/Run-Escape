//    on, scrambled by scramble presses (more with path levels). Light them all. Every darken
//    seconds (less with path levels) one goes dark again: a scarab's knocked it.

//    walking over them, each once. Over it, the roof comes down and they reset. The wiki's chart
//    of a way across for every number works on it as it does in OSRS.

//    on it from the start as OSRS's are, shuffled apart. Step on one on each board: the same,
//    they stay; not, the roof comes down. Solo, preSolved pairs (fewer with path levels) are done as it starts, as OSRS's
