# Developing Run Escape

How the code is laid out, the tools that come with it, and how to host a build. The
[README](../README.md) covers getting it running.

## Hosting

```
npm run build
npm run slim-cache
```

writes the game to `dist/`, with a slim copy of the cache in `dist/caches/`: only what the game
reads, about 26 MB instead of 227 MB. Put what's in `dist/` on a web server, at the site's root or
in a folder (asset paths are relative, so https://example.com/game/ works):

```
index.html
assets/
caches/caches.json
caches/osrs-241_2026-09-30-slim-<hash>/
```

`npm run slim-cache` loads everything the game loads (every model it bakes, an icon for every
item, each map's arena and the map squares around it) with the game's own loaders and keeps the
groups they read. Then it loads it all again from the slim copy and fails if anything is missing.
It takes a couple of minutes. Run it again after changing the content (a new enemy, item or map),
or the game stops on a "missing from the cache" error. The slim cache is named after what's in it,
so players' browsers fetch the new one and drop the old. `npm run preview` serves the build with
its slim cache, to try it before uploading. The full cache works too, if you'd rather host that.
The map viewer (`?viewer=1`) needs the full one.

The server has to send two headers with the page. The game shares the cache with its workers in
a SharedArrayBuffer, which browsers only allow on a cross-origin isolated page; without them the
game says so instead of loading:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

With nginx, in the game's `location` block:

```
add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy same-origin always;
add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy require-corp always;
```

With Apache, in an `.htaccess` beside `index.html` (needs mod_headers):

```
Header set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin"
Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
```

It needs HTTPS (or localhost) for the browser's cache storage, and a folder's address with its
trailing slash (`/game/`, not `/game`), or the relative paths point at the parent folder.

## Code

```
src/game/
  content/  enemies, weapons, passives, items (gear, utility, caskets), armoury (what each piece
            of gear upgrades into), power-ups and thralls, characters, shop, maps
            (arena, spawn, difficulty) and their waves: plain data with cache ids; unlocks
            (what each map's tasks bring in); quests (what each asks for and pays)
    fun/    the fun maps (endless, random bosses) and their players: outfits, chat, shots
  core/     the game in plain TypeScript (no DOM), tested with vitest
    Sim.ts            fixed 20ms tick: movement, enemies, spawning, weapons, pickups, power-ups,
                      levels
    world/            ArenaGrid (collision + heights), Collision (circle vs tiles and walls),
                      FlowField (Dijkstra from the player, how hundreds of enemies find a way)
    Upgrades.ts       level up choices
    Loot.ts           what's in a casket, the inventory
    save.ts           versioned save with migrations, shop, unlocks (maps, and the adventurers
                      and items earned by tasks), the gear found and the Armoury's upgrades,
                      quests (and the kills and caskets they count)
  client/   GameClient (run flow, camera, input), GameView (3D actors + 2D overlay),
            GameAssets (what gets baked), GameStore (state for the React UI)
  render/   GameWebGLRenderer (the map viewer's renderer with the game's passes), CameraRig
  ui/       React screens and HUD, ChestModal (the casket opening), ItemIcon
src/mapviewer/webgl/actor/   actor renderer: baked animation frames drawn anywhere in the world,
                             any number of them, one multi-draw per pass
src/mapviewer/worker/        RegionDataLoader (collision and heights for the whole arena in one
                             scene build), ItemIconLoader (inventory icons drawn like the client)
                             SoundLoader (sound effects synthesized off the main thread),
                             SpriteDataLoader (interface sprites, like hitsplats)
src/rs/audio/               the client's sound effect synth: instruments, envelopes, filters
src/rs/model/player/         player models from identity kits and worn items
```

Changes to the map viewer itself are small: the game subclasses its WebGL renderer, a few decoders
learned the rev 241 opcodes, and two bugs were fixed (floor collision missing on the edge of every
map square, and a resize during loading leaving the 3D view in a corner).

Combat sounds are picked by the server, not the cache, so the ids in `content/` come from the OSRS
Wiki's [list of in-game sound IDs](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/List_of_in-game_sound_IDs).

### Scripts

All run from the repository root with `npx tsx`:

```

scripts/cache/check-fun-outfits.ts       every item the fun maps' players wear is the one named, in its slot
scripts/cache/find-locs.ts multicannon   scenery ids

scripts/cache/slim-cache.ts [out dir]    the slim cache for hosting (npm run slim-cache)
scripts/game/simulate-run.ts [character] [seeds]        a bot plays full runs, for balancing
                                                        (MAP=barrows for another map,
                                                        META=max ARMOURY=max for everything
                                                        bought)
scripts/dev/icon-test.ts 1321            draw an item icon as ASCII
```

Tests: `npm test`.

URL flags: `?autostart=wizard` starts a run right away, `?stress=300` adds 300 goblins, `?viewer=1`
opens the original map viewer (loaded only then), `?bgtick` (dev only) keeps the game running in a
browser tab that isn't being painted, `?notice` shows the notice even after it's been closed. F3
shows collision and stats.

### Notice

Whatever's written in [public/notice.md](../public/notice.md) pops up on the title screen until the
player closes it, once: a `# Title`, then paragraphs and `- ` lists, with `**bold**`. Changing it
shows it to everyone again; with nothing but its comment there's no notice. It's fetched when the
game loads rather than built in, so on a hosted game `notice.md` can be edited on the server.

### Versions

The version is `package.json`'s, shown in the title screen's corner, and [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
says what changed in each one; the title screen shows it too. Note changes under Unreleased as
they're made. For a release, `npm version minor --no-git-tag-version` (or `patch` for fixes alone),
then turn Unreleased into the new version's heading with the date. A test checks the two agree.
